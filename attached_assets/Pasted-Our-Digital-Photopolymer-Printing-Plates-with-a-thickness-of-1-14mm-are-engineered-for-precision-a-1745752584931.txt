Our Digital Photopolymer Printing Plates, with a thickness of 1.14mm, are engineered for precision and performance in high-quality printing applications. These plates are designed to optimize hardness, resulting in the enhanced reproduction of intricate highlights and details, along with the ability to produce uniform and smooth vignettes. They deliver sharply defined texts, barcodes, and elements that are essential for modern label production. The superior ink transfer guarantees improved ink laydown, contributing to smooth and even solid colors. With digital imaging capabilities of up to 10,160 dpi, these plates ensure top-tier print quality with sharper images, open reverses, and finer highlights which are vital for professional-grade printing. The high flexibility of the polyester base allows easy adaptation to different cylinder diameters, while low curling promises smooth plate processing and better reusability. Our plates possess long-term durability and production consistency, leading to reduced operating costs. With exceptional stability in storage and reusability, they help lower expenses in repeat jobs and ensure consistent long-term repeatability. Specifically designed for high-performance label printing, these plates can handle line screen rulings of up to 200 lpi. Available in various thicknesses, we provide both water-washable and solvent-based plates tailored to our client’s specifications. We utilize PackZ software for designing artworks, equipped with industry-specific features, along with StudioRip software for ripping processed files. Each plate goes through rigorous quality checks by our experienced QC team, guaranteeing production excellence attained through over 20 years in the industry, where every plate meets the highest standards of consistency and quality.
